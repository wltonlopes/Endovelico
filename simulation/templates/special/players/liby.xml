    <History>The Garamanteswere ancient peoples, who may have descended from Berber tribes,
     Toubou tribes, and Saharan pastoralists that settled in the
     Fezzan region by at least 1000 BC and established
       a civilization that flourished until its end in the late 7th century ad. The Garamantes first
        emerged as a major regional power in the mid-2nd century ad and established a kingdom that spanned
         roughly 180,000m2 (70,000sqmi) in the Fezzan region of southern Libya. Their growth and expansion
          was based on a complex and extensive qanat irrigation system (Berber: foggaras), which supported a 
          strong agricultural economy and a large population.</History>
