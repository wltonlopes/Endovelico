    <History>The Kingdom of Armenia, also known as Greater Armenia, was a historic Armenian kingdom in the Ancient Near East, existing from 331 BC to 428 AD. It was divided into three dynasties: Orontid (331–200 BC), Artaxiad (189 BC – 12 AD), and Arsacid (52–428 AD). The kingdom's history was characterized by its location at the crossroads of the east and west, often caught between powerful empires like Rome and Parthia.</History>
