    <History>The sarmatians are a nomadic faction which can build its buildings anywhere on the map. Their buildings cost -50% resources and build time, but have -50% health and capture resistance. They have limited infantry, but a full roster of light and heavy cavalry. They have a raiding and looting bonus, and are excellent herders and hunters.</History>
