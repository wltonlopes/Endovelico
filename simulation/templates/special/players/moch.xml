    <History>The Moche were an ancient civilization in northern Peru (100–700 AD), renowned for their sophisticated irrigation systems, impressive pottery, and monumental architecture, including temples and pyramids. The Gallinazo culture, which preceded the Moche (200 BC–200 AD), was characterized by adobe constructions and early urbanization, significantly influencing Moche society and contributing to their cultural development.
