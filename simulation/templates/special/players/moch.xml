    <History>The Moche civilization, the Moche culture or the Early, Pre- or Proto-Chim√∫ 
      flourished in northern Peru with its capital near present-day Moche, Trujillo, Peru
      from about 100 to 700 AD during the Regional Development Epoch.
      While this issue is the subject of some debate, many scholars contend that the Moche were not politically
      organized as a monolithic empire or state. Rather, they were likely a group of autonomous polities that
      shared a common culture, as seen in the rich
      iconography and monumental architecture that survives today.
