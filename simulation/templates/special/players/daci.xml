    <History> The Dacians were an indigenous but Indo-European-speaking people who lived in the broad vicinity of Romania between 3000 BC and roughly AD 500.
      They were a people closely related to the Getae, speaking the same language, sharing very similar customs and allying with each other frequently,
      but the two, it seems, were separate political entities. At its greatest extent, Dacia was bounded by the Danube to the South, the Black Sea to the East,
      the Dniester to the Northeast, and the Pannonian Plain to the West: that is modern Romania and Moldovia, and parts of Bulgaria, Serbia,
      Hungary and Ukraine. The language spoken by the Dacians was Indo-European, but it had died out by the sixth century AD along with its speakers.
      Not enough evidence has survived to reconstruct it in hydronyms, toponyms and personal names, so there is still much debate as to whether it was 
      more closely related to Thracian or Illyrian, or whether one broad language-family was spoken across that entire area.</History>
