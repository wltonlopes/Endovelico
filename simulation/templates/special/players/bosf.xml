    <History> Bosporan Kingdom: This was an ancient Greco-Scythian state located on the Crimean
      Peninsula and the Taman Peninsula, centered around the Cimmerian Bosphorus (present-day Strait
      of Kerch). It was one of the first Hellenistic states, adopting Greek language and
      civilization under aristocratic leadership. The kingdom played a significant role in the
      region's history and briefly became a Roman client state.</History>
