    <History>The Garamantes (Ancient Greek: Γαράμαντες, romanized: Garámantes; Latin: Garamantes)
     were ancient peoples, who may have descended from Berber tribes, Toubou tribes, and Saharan
      pastoralists that settled in the Fezzan region by at least 1000 BC[4] and established
       a civilization that flourished until its end in the late 7th century AD. The Garamantes first
        emerged as a major regional power in the mid-2nd century AD and established a kingdom that spanned
         roughly 180,000m2 (70,000sqmi) in the Fezzan region of southern Libya. Their growth and expansion
          was based on a complex and extensive qanat irrigation system (Berber: foggaras), which supported a 
          strong agricultural economy and a large population. They subsequently developed the first urban society 
          in a major desert that was not centered on a river system; their largest town, Garama, had a population 
          of around four thousand, with an additional six thousand living in surrounding suburban areas. At its 
          pinnacle, the Garamantian kingdom established and maintained a "standard of living far superior to that 
          of any other ancient Saharan society" and was composed of "brilliant farmers, resourceful engineers,
     and enterprising merchants who produced a remarkable civilization".</History>
